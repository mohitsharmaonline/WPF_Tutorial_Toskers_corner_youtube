<!-- xmlns: xml namespaces which are very crutial to what we do 
    inside of our XAML and even interacting with things outside of
    our xaml. This is similar to having the "using namespaces" in
    your code behind.
    allows you to define aliases that directs you to URI namespaces.
    xmlns:prefix="URI"
    prefix: the short name (alias) using which you will refer 
    the namespace.
    URI: location URI of the namespace. (could be links to XML
    documentations or they could benamespaces to points in your 
    applications such as folders or even another solution.)
    
    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
    default namespace (without prefix) gives us our presentation 
    controls.
    
    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
    x is used for mapping xaml namespace in templates for projects
    
    x:Class="WPFTutorial.MainWindow"
    specifies a CLR namespace and a class name for the class that 
    provides code behind for our XAML page. (WPFTutorial.MainWindow)
    
    x:Name could be used to name our control throughout our application.
    by naming our controls allows us to reference it in our code behind
    
    xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
    d is for design time attributes, to tell the xaml parser not to
    interpret these attributes at runtime.
